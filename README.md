# Ext2-Filesystem
The Ext2 Filesystem is a project that contains implementation of tools that modify ext2-format virtual disks. This program is written in C that operates on an ext2 formatted virtual disk. This assignment was done to demonstrate our understanding of the theory behind Filesystems as part of the Operating Systems course. <br/><br/>
The following features were implemented as tools that can be utilized to operate in this filesystem.<br/>
```md
> ext2_cp
> ext2_mkdir
> ext2_ln
> ext2_rm
> ext2_restore
> ext2_checker
> ext2_ls
> ext2_dump
